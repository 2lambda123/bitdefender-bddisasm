# Valid operating modes for instructions. Please use these templates and not inline definitions. If a template does
# not exist already, create a new one.
# Syntax: NAME : group1:mode11[+mode12[|group2:!mode21+!mode22]] etc.
#
# NAME cam be anything and can be used as a placeholder when defining the instruction.
# group - can be one of the 4 operating groups: 
#         ring - specify the needed privilege level for the instruction
#         mode - specify the needed operating mode 
#         vmx  - specify the VMX operation mode
#         other- specify other misc operating modes/special cases
#
# ring  - can be any of:
#         r0 - instruction is valid in ring 0
#         r1 - instruction is valid in ring 1
#         r2 - instruction is valid in ring 2
#         r3 - instruction is valid in ring 3
#
# mode  - can be any of: 
#         real  - instruction valid in real mode (16 bit)
#         v8086 - instruction valid in virtual 8086 mode (16 bit inside 32 bit mode)
#         prot  - instruction valid in protected mode (32 bit)
#         compat- instruction valid in compatibility mode (32 inside 64 bit mode)
#         long  - instruction valid in long mode (64 bit) 
#         smm   - instruction valid in System Management Mode
#
# other - can be any of:
#         sgx - instruction is valid inside a Software Guard Extensions enclave
#         tsx - instruction is valid inside a Transactional Syncronization Extensions region
#
# vmx  - can be any of:
#         vmxr - instruction valid in VMX root mode
#         vmxn - instruction valid in VMX non-root mode
#         vmxo - instruction valid outside VMX operation
#
# If a group is not specified, all modes for that group will be considered valid.
# If only some modes are specified for a group, only they will be considered valid, and all the others invalid.
# If only some modes are specified negated (!), the instruction will be considered valid in all but the specified modes.
#
# For SGX and TSX, the most restrictive rule is applied: an instruction is listed as valid in any of these modes if
# it will always execute successfully; instructions that may be valid or invalid depending on microarchitectural
# design/conditions are listed as invalid in these modes.
#

# Instruction that are valid ONLY in VMX root operation; this also implies ring0, and only protected or long mode.
VMXROOT : ring=r0|vmx=vmxr|mode=prot+long|other=!sgx+!tsx

# Instructions valid only in VMX operation, be it VMX root or VMX non-root.
VMX     : vmx=!vmxo

# Instructions valid only in r0. SGX enclaves exist only in r3, so a 0 instruction will not be valid in SGX mode.
KERNEL  : ring=r0|other=!sgx

# Instructions valid only in r3.
USER    : ring=r3

# Instructions invalid in real mode. If an instruction is invalid in real mode, it will be invalid in v8086 as well.
NOREAL  : mode=!real+!v8086

# Instructions invalid in v8086 mode. They may be, however, valid in real mode.
NOV86   : mode=!v8086

# Instructions valid only in long mode (64 bit).
O64     : mode=long

# Instructions invalid in long mode.
NO64    : mode=!long

# Instructions invalid in transactional regions.
NOTSX   : other=!tsx

# Instructions invalid in SGX mode.
NOSGX   : other=!sgx

# Instructions valid only in SMM. Note that while in SMM, one can transition in protected/long mode.
SMM     : mode=prot+compat+long+smm

# Instructions invalid inside SMM, real-mode or V8086.
